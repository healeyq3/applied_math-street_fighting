    ~\cite{AA203} \textbf{HW0 Q1}. \textit{Discrete-time LTI stability}. Consider the system $x_{t+1} = Ax_t + Bu_t$, where
    \[A = \begin{bmatrix}
        4/5 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & \sqrt{3} & 1 \\
        0 & -1 & \sqrt{3}
    \end{bmatrix}, \quad 
    B = \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0
    \end{bmatrix}.
    \]

    \noindent (a) Explain whether or not this sytem is ``open-loop stable'' (asymptotically stable for $u_t \equiv 0$).\\
    \noindent \textbf{Response.} This sytem is unstable. To see this, note $\left| \lambda_1 \right| = \left| \lambda_2 \right| \approx 2$.
    (Most likely they equal two, the numerical computation via Python yields a magnitude of 1.99... with 15 trailing 9s). Recall
    that for a discrete time LTI system to be open-loop stable, the magnitude of all eigenvalues must be less than one.\\
    \noindent (b) Design a linear feedback controller $u_t = Kx_t$ with fixed gain matrix $K \in \mathbf{R}^{2 \times 3}$ such
    that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable.\\
    \textbf{Response.} This is a \textbf{state feedback control} problem where $K$ is the \textbf{state-feedback gain matrix}.
    In this setting, we can rewrite the LTI system as % link way of doing it in Boyd, but also do scikit way 
    % chatGPT suggested. Link more advanced sources too
    \[x_{t+1} = Ax_t + Bu_t = Ax_t + B(Kx_t) = (A + BK)x_t, \quad t=1, 2, \ldots\]
