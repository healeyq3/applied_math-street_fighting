    % mathematicians lament

    \section{What are These Notes?}
    % will be verbose in some areas, others less so
    % inspired by doc P examples
    % will include full write up in some cases, others not.
    % Optimization is main focus and we approach all problems from an optimization viewpoint.
    % => What does this mean: we will try to formulate an optimization problem
    % will keep with the overall structure of Boyd, but will change chapter structure some.
    % the point of changing chapter structure is personal for thinking about problems
    % try to make a point to emphasize numerics (including in probability theory)
    % sometimes these notes will contain references to books etc.
