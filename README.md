Personal Notes on Mathematical and Engineering techniques I wish to master.

See main_examples/main.pdf for a completed set of nine problems, which provide a good overview of the types of techniques the broader set of notes covers. (Todo: add some of the nine examples back into the main note set.)

See the examples subdirectory for all of the code used to generate figures/solve problems throughout these notes.
